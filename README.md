# The Default Frame

The default Maslow cnc frame

This frame was designed as the result of a massive community collaboration. It is designed to replace the old default frame. It is designed to be built anywhere in the world so the dimensions of the lumber are not critical, and no hardware is needed other than screws and glue.

The forum thread which discusses the design process can be found [here](https://forums.maslowcnc.com/t/sun-with-face-new-stock-frame-design-sun-with-face/2025). While 53 people contributed, @dlang and @madgrizzle deserve the bulk of the credit.
